Reused props from Gmap 

This is a free release. 

I am still new at mapping and learning so things are far from perfect.
Some known bugs and issues: (your welcome to fix and reupload)

Vanilla street lighting at night can still be seen. 
Peds walking on beach were getting stuck on the mcdonalds so I added some ramps to avoud this. 
KFC inside counter has no colission.

I slapped this together because I've never seen anything developed at this location. Its always been a great looking piece of land. 
I hope hope your community enjoys this.
